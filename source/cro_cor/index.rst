Ambient noise cross correlation
===============================

In this tutorial, we will introduce why and how to compute cross-correlation functions (CCFs) from seismic ambient noise data.

why?
----

CCF -> EGF

How?
----

#. cut and preprocess data
#. perform normalization
#. perform cross correlation
