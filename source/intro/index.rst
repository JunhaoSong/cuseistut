Introduction
############

This CUSeisTut was created to provide guidance and training for skillsets needed by seismologists. Over ten modules make up the training process, which are organized into three levels: Entry, Intermediate, and Advanced. The modules are designed in a step-by-step format and is friendly to students who have no prior expertise in scientific research. After finishing the online training modules, students are anticipated to develop sophisticated hands-on skills in seismology.

The first module in the Entry Level introduces the basic operation commands in processing the text file in the Linux system. This module seeks to familiarize users with the Linux environment and operations in terminals. The second module focuses on the most widely used mapping tool in seismology, The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT). In that module, we provide instructions for creating a map with various elements, such as earthquake locations, coast lines, and topography.

Seismology is an observations-based science. The seismograms, the records of ground shakings, include information about earthquakes and subsurface structures. Therefore, processing seismic data is a fundamental skillset in seismology. The final module in Entry Level block explains how to use ObsPy, a tool based on Python, to process seismic waveform data

Users can explore more challenging questions in seismology after being equipped with the skillsets in the Entry Level. In the intermediate Level training, we provide guidance and codes to illustrate the procedure for detecting and locating earthquakes from seismic waveform data. Furthermore, we provide the Advanced Level block for users’ interests, which focuses on two fundamental questions in seismology: how to resolve the earthquake source and earth structure. Understanding the Advanced Level modules requires more background knowledge in earthquake source physics and topography theories.
