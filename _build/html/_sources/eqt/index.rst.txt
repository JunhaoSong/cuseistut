Earthquake Transformer Tutorial
===============================

Brief introduction
------------------

Deep learning model for automatic detection
*******************************************

The neural network was first applied in seismology to pick arrival phases since 2006. The algorithm of using machine learning in seismology is to build a model and train it with large sets of well - labeled data. After training, the model can predict from a given sets of input which means it can detect the P - and S - waves automatically. We can also obtain the probability of the results so to evaluate the performance. 

There are numerous architecture of deep learning model. In seismology, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is commonly used for classifying the features. 

By setting up a robust automatic system, we can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the earthquake detection. 


What is Earthquake Transformer (EQT)
************************************

**Earthquake Transformer (EQT)** is one of the deep learning model for earthquake detection and phase picking. 

You can refer the architecture of EQT `here <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17591-w>`_. 

By using EQT, we can detect the earthquake phases (P & S) automatically. The model has been trained on global seismic data so we can simply apply it in different sites. 

How to install EQT
******************

.. note::
 | It's strongly recommended to install ObsPy via conda.
 | We here assume you have already installed conda on your computer after finishing the previous GMT tutorial. 
 | If not, please first install it (suggest installation of `miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_). 

Open your terminal and run the following commands.

.. code:: 

 $ conda create --name eat python=3.7
 $ conda activate eat
 $ conda install -c smousavi05 eqtransformer 

.. warning:: 

   Exclude $ sign and start without whitespace!

In case if you cannot install EQT using conda, you can try: 

.. code::

 $ pip install git+https://github.com/smousavi05/EQTransformer

1 Make the station list and Download the data
---------------------------------------------

1.1 Constrain the area and the time of interest
***********************************************

It is better for us to constrain a small area of interest, otherwise the downloading time will be extended. 

We will use the example from the ObsPy tutorial. But, we will download the continuous data using EQT this time.

.. code::

  # Area of interest

  # latitude
  lat_min = -8
  lat_max = -9

  # longitude
  lon_min = 122.5
  lon_max = 124.5

  # Time of interest
  # You can try with 1 day data first
  start_time = "2015-08-11 00:00:00.00"
  end_time = "2015-08-12 00:00:00.00"

1.2 Make Station list
*********************

Station list contains the information of the stations and it will help to find the waveforms by stations during the detection. 

.. code::

  import os
  json_basepath = os.path.join(os.getcwd(),"json/station_list.json")

  from EQTransformer.utils.downloader import makeStationList
  makeStationList(json_path=json_basepath, client_list=["IRIS"], min_lat=lat_min, max_lat=lat_max, min_lon=lon_min, max_lon=lon_max, start_time=start_time, end_time=end_time, channel_list=["HH[ZNE]", "HH[Z21]", "BH[ZNE]"])

``os.path.join`` combine one or more path names into a single path.

``makeStationList`` make the station list that is based on your interest and applicable for the earthquake transformer. 

Here is the example of the station list: :download:`station_list.json <./station_list.json>`.

It is a dictionary containing the **station name**, **network**, **channels** and **coordinates**.

.. note::

  You can also customise the station list by creating your own dictionary according to the format.

1.3 Download Data
*****************

We can download the waveform data directly from the EQT. The file names of the downloaded data must applicable to EQT. 

.. code::

  from EQTransformer.utils.downloader import downloadMseeds

  # We have already constrained the area and time of interest

  downloadMseeds(client_list=["IRIS"], stations_json=json_basepath, output_dir="mseed_data", min_lat=lat_min, max_lat=lat_max, min_lon=-lon_min, max_lon=lon_max, start_time=start_time, end_time=end_time, chunk_size=1, channel_list=[], n_processor=2)

``downloadMseeds`` download the waveform data according to your station list and your interest.

Make sure you have already made the station list before using this function. The data downloaded will be in mseed format and saved into a directory called **mseed_data**. 

.. note::

  If you have your own data, then you can skip this procedure.

---------

2 Detect Earthquake
-------------------

The idea of detecting earthquake is to input the waveform data and station list, then the model will classify the P - and S - wave together with their corresponding arrival time and save it according to the stations. 

There are many alternative ways to undergo the detection. We here introduce one of the method which is using the preprocessed data (hdf5 files). 

The hdf5 file can handle large datasets by slicing data and shorten the time of reading large chunk of individual waveforms. 

.. code::

  from EQTransformer.utils.hdf5_maker import preprocessor

  preprocessor(preproc_dir="preproc", mseed_dir='mseed_data', stations_json='json/station_list.json', overlap=0.3, n_processor=2)

``preprocessor`` prepare the data by slicing it into 1-min long Numpy array in hdf5 file and generate a CSV that contains the list of trace it the hdf5 file. 

.. note:: 

  Make sure you have preprocess the data using ``preprocessor`` before ``predictor``. 

After ``preprocessor`` , there will be a new directory name **mseed_data_processed_hdf5**. It will be used in the next step. 


.. code::

  from EQTransformer.core.predictor import predictor

  predictor(input_dir= 'mseed_data_processed_hdfs', input_model='EqT_model.h5', output_dir='detections', detection_threshold=0.3, P_threshold=0.1, S_threshold=0.1, number_of_plots=100, plot_mode='time')

``predictor`` predicts the earthquakes by naming the directories of input, output and the model. 

.. note:: 

  You can set up the detection according to different settings of your area. 

  The threshold of the detection should be adjusted with the ratio of false detection depending on the data noise level. For example, if the noise level is high in the studied region, then the threshold value has to be high in order to reduce the false detection. 

Here is the output files after the detection:

``X_report.txt`` the report contains information on input and final results (including total number of events that are detected) :download:`X_report.txt <./X_report.txt>`.

``X_prediction_results.csv`` the file contains detection and picking results :download:`X_prediction_results.csv <./X_prediction_results.csv>`.

``figures`` a directory saves all the plots of the detected events. 

Here is one of the output figures of the detected event:

.. image:: event.png
   :width: 70%

In this figure, we can see the probability and the arrival times of P - and S - waves. 

You can refer the same event in the ObsPy tutorial!


---------

3 Visualise the results
-----------------------

**Histogram**

.. code::

  from EQTransformer.utils.plot import plot_detections

  plot_detections(input_dir="detections", input_json="station_list.json", plot_type='station_map', marker_size=50)

``plot_detections`` generate map plot to visualise the number of detections over stations.

.. image:: station_map.png
   :width: 70%

.. note::

  The plot here simply show the distribution of the stations and the number of detections accordingly. You can use other method to plot in order the show a detailed map plot (i.e. GMT). 

---------

4 Phase association
-------------------

Phase association is used to review the detected seismic phases and group them together with the same origin of earthquake. 

After the phase picking process, you can undergo a simple association procedure. This can help you to proceed to the next step (relocation) easily.

.. code::

  from EQTransformer.utils.associator import run_associator

  run_associator(input_dir='detections', start_time="2015-08-11 00:00:00.00", end_time="2015-08-12 00:00:00.00",  moving_window=15, pair_n=3)

``run_associator`` perform simple and fast association for further relocation.

Output files:

 | 1. ``Y2000.phs`` results in HypoInverse format -> HypoInverse :download:`Y2000.phs <./Y2000.phs>`

 | 2. ``associations.xml`` ObsPy QuakeML format -> conventional location algorithms (i.e. NonLinLoc) :download:`associations.xml <./associations.xml>`

 | 3. ``traceName_dic.json`` dictionary saves the trace names for source waveforms of the detected events -> later access :download:`traceName_dic.json <./traceName_dic.json>`

.. note::

  Relocation is needed for accurate location.
