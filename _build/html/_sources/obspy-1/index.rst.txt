Seismic data request via ObsPy
=================================

Brief introduction
------------------

What is ObsPy?
**************

**ObsPy** is an open-source project dedicated to provide a **Python** framework for **processing seismological data**. It provides parsers for common file formats, clients to access data centers and seismological signal processing routines which allow the manipulation of seismological time series (copied from ObsPy Github page).

We assume that you already have some experience of using Python. If not, you are suggested to read this `small, incomplete introduction to the Python programming language <https://docs.obspy.org/tutorial/code_snippets/python_introduction.html>`_.

How to install ObsPy
********************

.. note::
 | It's strongly recommended to install ObsPy via conda.
 | We here assume you have already installed conda on your computer after finishing the previous GMT tutorial. 
 | If not, please first install it (suggest installation of `miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_). 

Open your terminal and run the following commands.

.. code:: 

 $ conda create --name obspy
 $ conda activate obspy
 $ conda install obspy=1.2

.. warning:: 

   Exclude $ sign and start without whitespace!

Contents of this tutorial
*************************

We will introduce how to request, read, visualize, and further process seismic data using a few basic ``functions`` in the ObsPy ``module``. it includes:

#. UTC DateTime
#. Basic Seismic Data Processing
#. Theoreotical Travel Time Calculation
#. Cross-section Plot with TauP arrivals

Developed by LAU Tsz Lam Zoe under the instructions of Junhao SONG, Han CHEN, and Suli Yao.

--------

1 UTC Date Time 
----------------------------

Now let's introduce the UTC DateTime format. 

The UTC DateTime is a Coordinated Universal Time. Usually we could see that HKT (UTC+8) or BJT (UTC+8), which means that Hong Kong or Beijing time is 8 hours earlier than UTC time. We usually use UTC Datetime to present the origin time of an earthquake. Seismic time-series data like digital seismograms also use UTC Datetime to present the time of each sample.

1.1 DateTime Initialization
***************************

First in the terminal, type ``python`` and then type ``enter``:

.. code::

 ## Method1
 >>>from obspy import UTCDateTime   ## import the module
 >>>year = 2022
 >>>month = 1
 >>>day = 7
 >>>hour = 17
 >>>minute = 45
 >>>second = 30.0
 >>>UTCDateTime(year, month, day, hour, minute, second)  ## make the UTCDateTime object according to the argument
 UTCDateTime(2022, 1, 7, 17, 45, 30)

 ##Method 2
 >>>UTCDateTime("2012-09-07T12:15:00")
 UTCDateTime(2012, 9, 7, 12, 15)

.. note::

 | There are many ways to produce the UTCDateTime object.
 | Method 1 & 2 are examples. You can explore others `here <https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.utcdatetime.UTCDateTime.html#obspy.core.utcdatetime.UTCDateTime>`_. 


1.2 DateTime Attribute Access
*****************************

Now we can assign the UTCDateTime object to a variable "time".

.. code::

 >>>time = UTCDateTime("2012-09-07T12:15:00")
 >>>print(time)
 2012-09-07T12:15:00.000000Z
 >>>print(type(time))
 <class 'obspy.core.utcdatetime.UTCDateTime'>

Then, since it's a python class object, we can extract different time information by using UTCDateTime built-in functions/atttributes.

.. code::

 >>>print(time.year)  ## only output the year of "time"
 2012
 >>>print(time.julday)  ## output the Julian day of "time"
 251
 >>>print(time.timestamp) ## output the UNIX timestamp format of "time".
 1347020100.0
 >>>print(UTCDateTime("1970-01-01").timestamp)
 0.0

.. note::
  
  | Julian Day is a continuous count of days since the beginning of the year.
  | Simple example: What is the July of 1st Feb, 2022?
  | Ans: 32

  | The UNIX timestamp format means the number of seconds since the Epoch. The reference time is: "1970-01-01" 

1.3 Handling time differences
*****************************

Calculate the time difference or add seconds into original "time"

.. code::

 >>>print(time - UTCDateTime("2012-09-07"))
 44100.0
 >>>time2 = time + 3600
 >>>print(time2)
 2012-09-07T13:15:00.000000Z
 
Clearly, we can see that "time2" is 1 hour (3600 seconds) later than "time".

2.1 Choose an event
*******************

You can select one event in the event list. 

.. note::
 | Here is the header information of the event list
 | indx year mon day time sec_relative_to_day res lat lon dep mag
 | 9393 2015 08 11 16:22:15.200000 58935.2000 1.403 -8.624 123.202 171.9 3.9

Input the origin time, coordinates and magnitude of the selected event.

.. code::
 
 from obspy import UTCDateTime
 origin_time = UTCDateTime("2015-08-11T16:22:15.200000")

 # Coordinates and the magnitude of the event 
 eq_lon = 123.202
 eq_lat = -8.624
 eq_dep = 171.9
 eq_mag = 3.9

2.2 Choose a station
********************

Choose one station from the station list.
Make sure the selected station is operating during the event. 

.. note::

 | Here is the header information of the station list.
 | Network | Station | Location | Channel | Latitude | Longitude | Elevation | Depth | Azimuth | Dip |   SensorDescription | Scale | ScaleFreq | ScaleUnits | SampleRate | StartTime | EndTime

 | YS|BAOP||BHZ|-8.4882|123.2696|67.0|0.0|0.0|-90.0|Nanometrics Trillium 120 Sec Response/Taurus Stand|1.19642E9|0.3|m/s|50.0|2014-10-31T00:00:00|2016-12-31T23:59:59

2.3 Get waveforms
*****************

Import the web service providers and input station information.

.. code::
 
 from obspy.clients.fdsn import Client

 # IRIS is one of those providers.
 client = Client('IRIS')    ##to initialize a client objectã€€(as IRIS here)

 # Input station informations
 # network
 net = 'YS'
 # station
 sta = 'BAOP'
 # location
 loc = ''
 # channel
 cha = 'BHZ'

 # starttime
 stt = origin_time
 # endtime
 edt = origin_time + 120

 # Get the waveforms from client
 st = client.get_waveforms(net, sta, loc, cha, stt, edt)  ## to get the waveform by the corresponding argument from clients.
 print(st)

.. note::
  | FDSN web services for data access to different web service providers.
  | IRIS is one of the web service providers which is commonly used.


2.4 Meta data
*************

We can print the meta data inside the stream.

.. code::

 print(st[0].stats)
 
.. code::  
 
                 network: YS
                station: BAOP
               location: 
                channel: BHZ
              starttime: 2015-08-11T16:22:15.200000Z
                endtime: 2015-08-11T16:24:15.200000Z
          sampling_rate: 50.0
                  delta: 0.02
                   npts: 6001
                  calib: 1.0
 _fdsnws_dataselect_url: http://service.iris.edu/fdsnws/dataselect/1/query
                _format: MSEED
                  mseed: AttribDict({'dataquality': 'M', 'number_of_records': 26, 'encoding': 'STEIM1', 'byteorder': '>', 'record_length': 512, 'filesize': 13312})

.. code::

 #You can print the corresponding attributes by calling them individually.
 print(st[0].stats.sampling_rate)

.. code::

 50.0



``.stats`` contains all header information of a Trace object. 


.. Tip::

 There are some default attributes. 

	========================== ===================================== =================== ==================================== 

	========================== ===================================== =================== ==================================== 
	``sampling rate``          Sampling rate in hertz                ``network``         Network code
	``station``                Station code                          ``channel``         Channel code
	``starttime``              UTCDateTime of the first data sample  ``endtime``         UTCDateTime of the last data sample
	``gcarc``                  Epicentral distance                   ``baz``             Back azimuths
	========================== ===================================== =================== ==================================== 

 For ``gcarc`` and ``bac`` , they are available in sac file. You can print them by: 

 .. code::

   print(st[0].stats.sac.gcarc)
   
   # If the header value is empty, you can assign value into the header.
   st[0].stats.sac.gcarc = 10000

2.5 Plot the waveforms
**********************

Here we plot the waveforms without any preprocessing procedure.

.. code::

 st.plot();
 
.. image:: plot_raw.png
  :width: 80%
 
.. code::
 
 st.spectrogram();
 
.. image:: spectrogram_raw.png
  :width: 80%

.. note::

 Spectrogram is a frequency content of a seismogram. You can check the energy level of the waves over time. 

2.6 Waveform Cross-section Plot
*******************************

Plot a record section.

2.6.1 Get the waveform data with more than 1 station
****************************************************

For our example, station 'BAOP', 'HADA', 'SINA' 'BKOR' and 'ALRB' are located near the epicentre of the earthquake.
It is expected that these 5 stations can record the event well. 

.. image:: section_station.png
   :width: 60%

.. code::
 
 # Set up a list for bulk request
 bulk = [('YS', 'BAOP', '', 'BHZ', origin_time, origin_time+120), 
         ('YS', 'HADA', '', 'BHZ', origin_time, origin_time+120), 
         ('YS', 'SINA', '', 'BHZ', origin_time, origin_time+120), 
         ('YS', 'BKOR', '', 'BHZ', origin_time, origin_time+120), 
         ('YS', 'ALRB', '', 'BHZ', origin_time, origin_time+120)]

 st_bulk = client.get_waveforms_bulk(bulk)
 print(st)


``get_waveforms_bulk`` send a bulk request for waveforms to the server


2.6.2 Calculate the great circle distance from stations to earthquake
*********************************************************************

.. code::

 # Input the coordinates of stations 
 ALRB_loc = [-8.2194, 124.4115]
 BAOP_loc = [-8.4882, 123.2696]
 BKOR_loc = [-8.4868, 122.5509]
 HADA_loc = [-8.3722, 123.5454]
 SINA_loc = [-8.1838, 122.9124]
 
 from obspy.geodetics import gps2dist_azimuth

 # Loop, get the station coordinates and calculate the distance 
 for tr in st_bulk:
     sta = tr.stats.station
     if sta == 'ALRB':
         sta_lat = ALRB_loc[0]
         sta_lon = ALRB_loc[1]
     if sta == 'BAOP':
         sta_lat = BAOP_loc[0]
         sta_lon = BAOP_loc[1]
     if sta =='BKOR':
         sta_lat = BKOR_loc[0]
         sta_lon = BKOR_loc[1]
     if sta =='HADA':
         sta_lat = HADA_loc[0]
         sta_lon = HADA_loc[1]
     if sta =='SINA':
         sta_lat = SINA_loc[0]
         sta_lon = SINA_loc[1]
    
     tr.stats.distance = gps2dist_azimuth(sta_lat, sta_lon,eq_lat, eq_lon)[0]

 # To check the result, you can print the distance with stations.
 for tr in st_bulk:
    print(tr.stats.station, tr.stats.distance)

``gps2dist_azimuth`` calculate the distance between two geographic points and forward and backward azimuths between these points

.. note::
 
 | As the mseed file does not contain the location of station, we have to get the information from the station list.
 | We also have to save the calculated distance into the metadata, as the value is empty initially. 

2.6.3 Plot the waveform cross-section plot
******************************************
``stream.plot`` allows us to plot the streams at the same figure. For example, we can plot all stream with the same X axis:
 
.. code::

 st_bulk.plot(size=(1600,800))  ## size=(1600,800) sets the figure size

.. image:: stream-plot.png
   :width: 100%

We can also plot the streams in a cross-section view:

.. code::

 st_bulk.plot(type='section')  ## type='section' indicates a record section can be plotted

.. image:: section-plot.png
   :width: 70%

.. note::

 We could add more features to the plot, for example, the phase arrivals, and the station names. It is a good way for us to recognize different seismic phases, We can also get the apparent velocity of P - and S - waves from the plot. We will introduce these in the next section.
